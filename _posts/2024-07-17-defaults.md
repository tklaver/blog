On Mastodon, I once said "My default apps list? Everything that Apple offers. Saved you a post." But I can't dismiss that I also needed content for the blog. My list is almost a 1:1 copy of Adam's app defaults list. I made changes though because I don't use any coding apps besides Shortcuts and I had to include the most important tool in my life - Routinery.

## Routinery

Nothing about this list is special, except for Routinery. It's an app for people with neurodivergent brains who need help retaining focus. I use it for my morning routines every single step is in there, doing household tasks and making sure I take breaks, too, et cetera. It's not like a pomodoro app, though. If I figure out a way to write about it, I will.
