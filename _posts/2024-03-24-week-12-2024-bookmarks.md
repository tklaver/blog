# Week 12 2024 Bookmarks

## 👤 Life
- ✍🏻 I've started to prepare my day the night before. It's almost the same checklist as the morning one but now I added a step to journal a bit about my day as well:
- 〰️ One line a day. I gave my spouse one of those One Line a Day diaries that makes keeping a diary extremely low-key. Just write a line (or more) and you're done. I do the same thing now too but I write it in Day One.

## 📠 Apps
- ⭐️ [Attention Management App for Mac](https://n10.app/) - A fantastic (and finally a reasonably priced app) that pulses visually to remind you to keep focusing on your tasks.
- [Across: Modern Calendar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/across-modern-calendar/id6444851827) - I spotted this one on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1bh54z7/across_calendar_app/). Never saw this app before but it's got a ton of ways to view your calendar. For Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.
- [Empty Fasting](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/empty-fasting/id6475213946) - Cute little paid up-front app to track your fasting routine. Haven't tried this one but it does look like it's just enough.
- [My curated list of great free apps for Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1bghh3b/my_curated_list_of_great_free_apps_for_mac/) - Someone (on Reddit) compiled a great list, you'll probably find a nice utility ([I hosted it here so you don't have to visit Reddit](https://tomk.paste.lol/reddit_my_curated_list_of_great_free_apps_for_mac)).

## 🌎 Cool sites
* ⭐️ [Inclusive Sans](https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusive-sans) - Nice new font that came out that improves readability and accessibility. Might switch my font to this one sometime.
* [Nothing to Fear | Demystifying Death to Live More Fully](https://www.hospicenursejulie.com/book) - I came across Hospice Nurse Julie on YouTube and this seems like a book anyone with fear of death can use.
* [Dead Simple Sites - Minimal Website Inspiration](https://deadsimplesites.com/) - Reeeaaally simple sites.
* [Alone No More \(Weeknotes \#24-11\)](https://mihobu.lol/2024/03/weeknotes-week-11-2024) - Just love this way of writing about your week. I took it to action already ☺️

## 🗞️ Read
* ⭐️ [What the world needs](https://adactio.com/journal/20996) - Don't write for the world. Write for yourself. The world doesn't need you but you need you.
* [The problem with AI](https://gomakethings.com/the-problem-with-ai/) - "Spoiler alert: if you’re a fan of AI, you’re going to hate today’s article." You're going to love-hate this article if you hate AI, too.
* [People with ADD/ADHD love using mymind](https://mymind.com/adhd) - Apparently the service I've been using for my bookmarks has been working well with my brain for a reason. 😄

## 📼 Watched
- ⭐️ [The mind-blowing scale of The Milky Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsRmyY3Db1Y) - I don't want to spoil anything so if you can watch any space video this week, make sure it's this one. Puts the Milky Way galaxy and our cute little solar system that fits on the tip of your finger into perspective.
- [I put 4 Million Suns in a Black Hole over New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUUT2Y_9qk) - Puts black holes into perspective. He actually pulls it off. 🤯
- [What does the speed of light look like on earth?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BTxxJr8awQ) - So simple but so cool!
- [2005 \(1985 Parody\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaAYUZqZvlA&list=LL&index=6) - I'm so happy that I discovered my music taste in the early 2000s. This clip is a great representation of that time.
- [What Red Hot Chili Peppers sound like to people who don't like Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE5JMEu5hZA&pp=ygUQcmhjcCBzb3VuZHMgbGlrZQ%3D%3D) - "Now it's time to reiterate California" oh man, that had me.
