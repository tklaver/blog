Just deleted 18 years worth of emails from my Gmail account. Apart from YouTube, I want them to have as little data of me as possible. I don't see why I would need so much history of me lying around.

Granted, I've used my Gmail account actively for about 6-7 years, so that's the weight of my actual history there.
