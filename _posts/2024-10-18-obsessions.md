A running list of my obsessions. Started on Oct. 18, 2024.

## Current obsession

**Taylor Swift, The Tortured Poets Department**

Ongoing as of July 2024

What an insane album. I always thought my favorite album of hers was 1989, which released in 2014, but after hearing The Tortured Poets Department I can only think that if this is the only record I could ever listen to, I would be completely OK.

## Past obsessions

No past obsessions here yet. They will come!
