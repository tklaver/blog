I still haven't found a design that works for me. I'm using [opencolor](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) because I need _some_ kind of direction of what works together. Now it's up to fonts and the right kind of spacing between elements. I don't even know where to begin. When should I use margins? And paddings? When do I use classes and IDs?

I know it's not the most important thing in the world, but I want this place to feel like _my place_. And I want visitors to feel like my place is worth their time.
