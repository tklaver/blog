# Week 11 2024 Bookmarks

## 📠 Apps
* ⭐️ [Solid Calendar](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/solid-calendar/id6448245807) - Underrated new calendar app. I love the Timeline view that looks like what Google Calendar uses.
* [Evo - The Everything App](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/evo-the-everything-app/id6475402655) - Super great new productivity app! The dev is super responsive over iMessage 😄
* [Twodos - Simple Todos](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6463499163) - Really cool and simple to-do app. Two vertical sections you can move tasks between: Sooner & Later. Hide a section for ultimate focus.

## 🌎 Cool sites
* ⭐️ [Aegi's Cafe ](https://aegi.neocities.org/) - I just saw this website for the first time. My goal is to have a nice little place for myself like this.
* [My favorite places on Google Earth :: Like Home](https://likehome.neocities.org/other/earthfavorites) - Such a nice idea to list pretty places on Earth.
* [Daily log ](https://aegi.neocities.org/digitalgarden/notes/dailylog) - I liked this minimal way of blogging.
* [yuqiboy](https://yuqiboy.com/posts/page/9/) - Looks like this person has found their outlet to just share whatever they're thinking. I admire that. Also because it's so anonymous. It's got me thinking. 🤔

## 🗞️ Read
* ⭐️ [Neatnik Notes · Motive as a filter](https://notes.neatnik.net/2024/03/motive-as-a-filter) - Great read on choices we can make. If you don't pay for a tool, question what their motive is.
* [The Dead World of Blippi ❧ Current Affairs](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/the-dead-world-of-blippi) - 
* [Use your Mac the way I do: a thought experiment](https://blakewatson.com/journal/use-your-mac-the-way-i-do-a-thought-experiment/) - Loved following this thought experiment. It also took me back to my youth, described in [my post on Mastodon](https://social.lol/@tomk/112109941942533995).
* [The end of the MrBeast era](https://www.polygon.com/24093399/end-of-mrbeast-youtube-era) - I always feel so mindless after watching a few MrBeast videos. I'm happy that something is changing.
* [How the calendar became the all-in-one productivity app](https://creativerly.com/how-the-calendar-became-the-all-in-one-productivity-app/) - I keep looking for new calendar apps (see the Apps section above).
* [Neatnik Notes · App Defaults](https://notes.neatnik.net/2024/01/app-defaults) - I'm writing my own app defaults as we speak (not literally because I'm writing this now).
* Don't know who they're quoting, but it makes sense: "Quote of the day: "I need privacy, not because my actions are questionable, but because your judgement and intentions are"" [@bijram@graz.social
